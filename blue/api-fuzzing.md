# API Fuzzing

## Activities

- Perform API fuzzing regarding parameter names, malicious values, and unknown endpoints.

## Benefits

- The developed software is not vulnerable to well established attacks.

## Assessment

- Show the usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
