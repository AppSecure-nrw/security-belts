# Regular Advanced Mob Hacking

Developers of your team participate in mob hacking sessions - organized by the Security Champion Guild - on a regular basis.
The goal of the sessions is to train the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities,
which mainly happens using an intercept proxy directly in the http request/response.
Just like in mob programming there is one driver and several navigators.

Guidelines for your advanced mob hacking session:
- Basic technical and security knowledge is required.
- Use an environment where hacking is allowed and does not harm your production.
- Use dedicated tools for intercepting/manipulating web requests, e.g., [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- Use an insecure training app, e.g., [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
- Encourage active participation, e.g., use small groups.
- Allow enough time for understanding the identified exploits.
- Track progress of the participans over time regarding relevant exploits.

## Benefits

- Improve security knowledge within the team.
- Understanding advanced security threats, vulnerabilities, hacking methods, and security tools.
- The team understands that even implemented security features can be insecure and exploitable.

## Assessment

- Report on the experiences from the sessions.
- Report on your lessons learned.
