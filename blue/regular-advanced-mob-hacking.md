# Regular Advanced Mob Hacking

## Activities

- Developers of your team participate in mob hacking sessions - organized by the Security Champion Guild - on a regular basis.
- Train the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities, by using an intercepting proxy, e.g., [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp).

Guidelines for your advanced mob hacking session:
- Just like in mob programming, there is one driver and several navigators.
- Basic technical and security knowledge is required.
- Use an environment, where hacking is allowed and does not harm your production.
- Use dedicated tools for intercepting/manipulating web requests, e.g., [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp).
- Use an insecure training app, e.g., [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
- Encourage active participation, e.g., use small groups.
- Allow enough time for understanding the identified exploits.
- Track progress of the participants over time regarding relevant exploits.

## Benefits

- The team improves their security knowledge.
- The team understands advanced security threats, vulnerabilities, hacking methods, and security tools.
- The team understands that even implemented security features can be insecure and exploitable.

## Assessment

- Report on the experiences from the sessions.
- Report on your lessons learned.
