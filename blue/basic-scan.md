# Basic Scan

## Activities

- Use dynamic security scanning tools to find security vulnerabilities in all components of your developed software.

## Benefits

- Typical low hanging fruit vulnerabilities can be found and fixed.
- The developed software is not vulnerable to well established attacks.

## Assessment

- Show the usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
