# Code Review

Perform code reviews of all code changes on software and infrastructure within the team. Make sure that only approved changes are merged to your main branch within your version control system. A common solution is the use of pull requests in GitHub.

## Benefits

- New vulnerabilities may be found before reaching production.
- Old vulnerabilities are found and fixed.
- Assurance of high code quality.

## Assessment

- Present the established review process.
  - How are findings handled?
  - What conclusions/measures result from these reviews?
  - How is compliance with the process guaranteed?
