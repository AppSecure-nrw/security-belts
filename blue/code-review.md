# Code Review

## Activities

- Perform code reviews of all code changes on software and infrastructure within the team.
- Ensure that knowledge gained from the [Security Code Review](../yellow/security-code-review.md) is applied here.
- Make sure that only approved changes are merged to your main branch within your version control system. A common solution is the use of pull requests in GitHub.

## Benefits

- New vulnerabilities may be found before reaching production.
- Old vulnerabilities are found and fixed.
- Assurance of high code quality.

## Assessment

- Present the established review process.
  - How are findings handled?
  - What conclusions/measures result from these reviews?
  - How is compliance with the process guaranteed?
