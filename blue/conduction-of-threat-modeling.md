# Conduction of Threat Modeling

## Activities

- Identify threats by performing threat modeling (e.g., apply [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security))) for your product including all internal, external, and third-party components (e.g., services, databases) and interactions between them.
- Keep the model up to date.
- Identify and address the resulting risks.
- Perform regularly reviews of the security mechanisms of your architecture.

## Benefits

- Early (i.e., during design phase) detection & mitigation of possible threats.
- Relevant security considerations are performed.
- Common understanding of the product architecture.

## Assessment

- Show your threat model(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
