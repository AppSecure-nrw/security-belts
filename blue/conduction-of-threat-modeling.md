# Conduction of Threat Modeling

Identify threats by performing threat modeling for your product including all (internal & external/third-party) components (e.g., services, databases) and interactions between them.
A common threat modeling framework is [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)).
Keep the model up to date and perform regularly reviews of the security mechanisms of your architecture.

## Benefits

- Early (i.e., during design phase) detection & mitigation of possible threats.
- Relevant security considerations are performed.
- Common understanding of the product architecture.

## Assessment

- Show your threat model(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
