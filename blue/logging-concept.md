# Logging Concept

## Activities

Create a logging concept considering the following aspects:
- Which data classification does your log data have?
  - Does your data include PII (personally identifiable information)?
- Which regulatory requirements apply to your software?
- How do you restrict the access to your log data?
- How do you protect your log data against tampering?
- What is the retention time of your log data? Consider:
  - Investigative purposes in case of a security incident.
  - Regulatory requirements.

## Benefits

- Appropriate protection of log data.
- Trustworthy log data: You reliably know what your application did last summer.
- In case of an incident, you can comprehend the actions performed by the attacker(s).

## Assessment

- Present the implementation of your concept, answering the questions above.
- Show the oldest irregularity in your logs.
- Are you sure it is legal to log this data?
