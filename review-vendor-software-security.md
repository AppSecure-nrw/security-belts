# Review Vendor Software Security

Review the SDLC of your software vendors to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your suppliers. Asking simple question will hopefully race awareness for the topic and make your expectations regarding software security clear.

## Risk

- Security is not considered by software vendors during development which leads to vulnerabilities that are first discovered in your production environment.

## Assessment

- Show your software vendors.
- Talk about your key takeaways of the vendors security SDLC (positive and negative ones).
