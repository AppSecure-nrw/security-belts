# Security Belts

> The maturity model *Security Belts* structures activities of the secure software development and, thus, offers development teams a good opportunity to address the topic and to build up necessary competencies to ensure the software security of their products. Thereby, the maturity model supports development teams that are overwhelmed with the duty to take over much more responsibility without having sufficient competencies in the team.

## Introduction

Due to the increasing requirements on the security of software products and new evolving development methodologies, development teams have to take much more responsibility for the software security of their product. However, as recent studies and security incidents indicate, development teams are overwhelmed with this duty, since they are not aware of the topic and do not have sufficient competencies.

The maturity model *Security Belts* pursues the idea of providing development teams reasonable activities to improve software security without overwhelming them with the complexity of the topic. The maturity model conveys values that are based on [The Five Ideals Of DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/five-ideals-of-devops/), which we believe are essential to successfully deliver secure software. In the maturity model, the individual degrees of maturity are represented as belts, which are known from various martial arts such as judo.

By applying the maturity model, the development teams continuously improve themselves and build up the necessary knowledge for the topic. Furthermore, they are requested to deal with software security early on and continuously in the software development process and, thereby, they minimize the risk of insecure releases and security incidents during operation.

On an organizational level, it is crucial that software security is not the task of a centralized team or department but that each development teams is responsible for the software security of its products. In addition, the organization must be aware of the software security requirements for each of its products and the skills needed to meet those requirements. Based on these requirements, the organization can deduce for each product (e.g., via a risk analysis), which belt the development team must at least have. As a consequence, not every team has to achieve the highest belt.

## The Concept

A belt comprises several activities from different areas, whereby each activity contributes to the improvement of software security. Within the maturity model, the belts are tailored so that they can be achieved within a quarter of year. 

The white belt - with its activities - is our starting point and shall lay the organizational basis for the improvement of your software security. All other belts (yellow, orange, etc.) directly improve the team and its product. The activities with the best benefit to cost ratio are assigned to early belts (yellow, etc.). Therefore, activities in later security belts have a reduced benefit to cost ratio. Nevertheless, they are still worthwile if the product has critical software security requirements.

At the moment benefit and cost values are based on expert judgment. In the future, we seek to measure these
values, so that the maturity model gets more accurate and profound. Furthermore, each belt follows the
following rules, which we consider useful.
1. Each Security Belt improves transparency to help the team to better understand and communicate to their stakeholders how well it ensures software security.
2. Each Security Belt supports the team to automate and standardize their new security tasks by introducing at least one new tool.

## Belt Activities

The belt activities serve as a checklist for the team and give additional information to accomplish these activitites. In particular, they consist of:
- a brief task description the team,
- a list of further readings to learn more about this topic,
- references to related activities (if necessarry),
- the benefits of this activity, and
- a checklist for the asssessment of the belt.

## The Belts and their Activities

### Prerequisites
Before any team can achieve a specific belt, the Security Champion Guild needs to lay the prerequisites for the teams accordingly. 

- [Prerequisites](prerequisites/README.md)


### Belts
Working on the belts is a continuous effort. Start with the first belt, the white one, and keep working on them, until you achieve the desired belt for your team. Activities of later belts often relate to activities introduced in previous belts. In this case, the previous relevant belt activities will be highlighted for the belt activity.
