# Security Belts

> The maturity model *Security Belts* structures activities of the secure software development and, thus, offers development teams a good opportunity to address the topic and to build up necessary competencies to ensure the software security of their products. Thereby, the maturity model supports development teams that are overwhelmed with the duty to take over much more responsibility without having sufficient competencies in the team.

Due to the increasing requirements on the security of software products and new evolving development methodologies, development teams have to take much more responsibility for the software security of their product. However, as recent studies and security incidents indicate, development teams are overwhelmed with this duty, since they are not aware of the topic and do not have sufficient competencies.

The maturity model *Security Belts* pursues the idea of providing development teams reasonable activities to improve software security without overwhelming them with the complexity of the topic. The maturity model conveys values that are based on [The Five Ideals Of DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/five-ideals-of-devops/), which we believe are essential to successfully deliver secure software. In the maturity model, the individual degrees of maturity are represented as belts, which are known from various martial arts such as judo.

By applying the maturity model, the development teams continuously improve themselves and build up the necessary knowledge for the topic. Furthermore, they are requested to deal with software security early on and continuously in the software development process and, thereby, they minimize the risk of insecure releases and security incidents during operation.

On an organizational level, it is crucial to enable software security to function decentralized across multiple teams. In addition, the organization must be aware of the requirements for its product and the skills needed to meet those requirements. Based on these requirements, it can deduced which belt a team should have. Each team doesn't need to have the highest belt.

Within the maturity model, the belts are tailored so that they can be achieved within a quarter. A belt comprises several activities from different areas, whereby each activity contributes to the improvement of software security.

The activities are sorted according to their benefit to cost ratio. Thus, activities in the lower belts have a large impact on the improvement of software security and quality, and at the same time, they require only limited time and skill of the development team. In contrast, activities in higher security belts demand more time and skills from the development and their benefits are not applicable in general. However, if the software is part of critical infrastructures with high requirements on software security, these activities help to fulfill the requirements.

At the moment benefit and cost values are based on expert judgment. In the future, we seek to measure these
values, so that the maturity model gets more accurate and profound. Furthermore, each belt follows the
following rules, which we consider useful.
1. Each Security Belt introduces at least one new tool or technical feature.
2. Each Security Belt improves transparency to help the team to better understand and communicate to their stakeholders how well it ensures software security.
