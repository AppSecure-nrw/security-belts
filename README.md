# Security Belts

With modern software development methodologies such as DevOps, development teams have the need to take over responsibility for software security for their product themselves. To avoid security fire drills right before deployment, the team must deal with security early on and continuously in its software development process. To empower the teams to handle software security well, they must build up knowledge and awareness for the subject. However, even more fundamental is their commitment to continuously improve themselves. On an organizational level, it is crucial to enable software security to function decentralized across multiple teams.

The Security Belts model is a maturity model and thus pursues the idea of providing development teams reasonable activities to improve software security without overwhelming them with the complexity that the subject entails.
The model shall convey values that are based on [The Five Ideals Of DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/five-ideals-of-devops/), which we believe are essential to successfully deliver secure software. In the model, the individual degrees of maturity are represented as belts, which are known from various martial arts such as judo.

Every activity in this model that improves software security is sorted into one of the belts according to its benefit to cost ratio. Activities in the lower belts are not so expensive in terms of time and skill requirements and probably bring the most benefits for software security. The higher the belt, the more demanding the activities and their benefits are less generally applicable.  At the moment benefit and cost values are based on expert judgment. In the future we seek to measure these values, so that the model get's more acurate and profound.
Furthermore, each belt follows the following rules, which we consider useful.
1. You do not talk about .... nope, it is: Each Security Belt introduces at least one new tool or technical feature.
2. Each Security Belt improves transparency to help the team to better understand and communicate to their stakeholders how well it ensures software security.
