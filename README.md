## Roles

### Security Champion

The Security Belts model depends on the existence of several roles from the Agile methodology such as Developer, Product Owner (PO), and Scrum Master who together form the so called *team*. Security Belts adds the role of the Security Champion.

The Security Champion is a developer with profound security knowledge that consults the team and explains the importance and complexity of security. Security Champions do need dedicated time to implement belt activities within their teams.

Security Champions must attend qualified training such as:
- [Fraunhofer IEM - Security Champion Training](https://www.iem.fraunhofer.de/de/academy/schulungsangebot/security-champion-training.html)
- TODO

The role of the Security Champion is important in order that the team is able to take over responsibility for software security for their product and to improve themselves.

### Security Champion Guild

The Security Champion Guild is a guild as known from the [Spotify model](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify). Security Champions can participate to get feedback on security related topics from outside their teams such as individual questions, second opinions, and code/concept reviews.

The main task of the guild is to spread the Security Belts model in the organization. The guild conducts belt exams and actively improves the model.

All Security Champions and only these are part of the guild otherwise champions are not learning from each other as well as the quality of outcome is reduced.
