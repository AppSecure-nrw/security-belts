# Get to Know Security Policies

Identify the security policies of your company and adhere to them. Share with the guild how you perform the required activities from the policies so others can benefit from your experience. In addition provide feedback to the policy owner. Whenever you find yourself not adhering to the policies communicate this to your product owner, manager, or the person responsible for judging risks vs. revenue on your product, so they are aware of being out of policy.

## Risk

- Building and operating software securely is hard; not utilizing standards (as described in the security policies) makes it even harder.
- Basic security risks - covered by security policies - are not handled at all.
