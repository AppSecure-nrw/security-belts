# Utilize Paring

When implementing a security belt activity, approach a peer from the security champion guild to get you started.

## Risk

- Knowledge how to implement security belt activities is not spread, so everyone has to reinvent the wheel.
- Starting to implement security belt activities alone is hard.
- The team is not improving its software security.
