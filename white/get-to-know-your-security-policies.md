# Get to Know Your Security Policies

## Activities

- Identify the security policies of your organization and adhere to them.
  - If there are no security policies, this must be made transparent to the management.
  - Be aware, security policies alone do not ensure secure software, they can only serve as a framework.
- Share with the Security Champion Guild how you perform the required activities from the policies, so others can benefit from your experience. In addition, provide feedback to the policy owner.
- Whenever you find yourself not adhering to the policies, communicate this to the person responsible for judging "risks vs. revenue" on your product (e.g., your Product Owner, manager), so they are aware of being out of policy.

## Benefits

- Building and operating software securely is hard; utilizing standards (as described in the security policies) makes it at least a bit easier.
- Basic security risks, which are covered by security policies, are handled.

## Assessment

- The white belt shall create the commitment to work on the Security Belts. Therefore, it does not require any assessment.
