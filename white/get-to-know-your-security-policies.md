# Get to Know Your Security Policies

Identify the security policies of your organization and adhere to them. 

Share with the security champion guild how you perform the required activities from the policies so others can benefit from your experience. In addition, provide feedback to the policy owner. Whenever you find yourself not adhering to the policies, communicate this to the person responsible for judging "risks vs. revenue" on your product (e.g., your Product Owner, manager), so they are aware of being out of policy.
