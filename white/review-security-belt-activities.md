# Review Security Belt Activities

Whenever implementing a security belt activity within a team, the implementation shall be reviewed through the security champion guild. Do this as soon as possible to eradicate misunderstandings of security belt activity descriptions early.

## Risk

- The quality of the implementation is not transparent.
- Successes are not intermediately celebrated.
- Only late feedback on the belt assessment.
