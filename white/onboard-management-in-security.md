# Onboard Management in Security

Software vulnerabilities might be exploited when shipped into production. This results in risks for the organization. The person responsible for judging "risks vs. revenue" on your product (e.g., Product Owner, manager) must be convinced that continuously improving security through Security Belts is the best way to minimize risk and build better products. Judging about security risks requires company specific understanding about security risk management. Ensure that the aforementioned roles have this knowledge and train them if this is not the case.
- Identify the persons who are judging "risks vs. revenue".
- Raise the awareness of these persons (e.g., show how easy it is to exploit software).
- Convince these persons that security is a continuous effort and that Security Belts are a cost efficient solution.

## Risk

- Product Owner is not aware that software can have security vulnerabilities.
- No resources are allocated to improve in security to avoid, detect and fix security vulnerabilities.
- Management cannot perform well informed decision when judging "risks vs. revenue".
- Product Owner has no transparency on how secure the product is.
