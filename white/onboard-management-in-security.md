# Onboard Management in Security

Product Owner, manager, or the person responsible for judging risks vs. revenue on your product must be convinced that improving security through security belts is the right way to minimize risk and build better products. Judging about security risks requires company specific understanding about security risk management. Ensure that the aforementioned roles have this knowledge and train them if this is not the case.

## Risk

- Product Owner is not aware that software can have security vulnerabilities.
- No resources are allocated to improve in security to avoid, detect and fix security vulnerabilities.
- Management can not perform well informed decision when judging risks vs. revenue.
- Product Owner has no transparency on how secure the product is.
