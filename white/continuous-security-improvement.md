# Continuously Improve your Security Belt

Security is like a big elephant. You cannot eat it as a whole, but you can slice it and continuously eat small pieces. To make this happen, ensure that the Product Owner continuously prioritizes security belt activities within the product backlog. Security belt activities make good pieces because they are of reasonable size and have a defined output. Celebrate all your implemented security belt activities.

## Risk

- The team "has no time" to improve its software security.
- The team's initially good intention turns into frustration.
- Product Owner has no transparency of the investment and benefit of security belts.
- The team is not improving its software security.
