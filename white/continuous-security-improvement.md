# Continuously Improve your Security Belt

Security is like a big elephant. You can not eat it as a whole, but you can slice it and continuously eat small peaces. To make this happen, ensure that the Product Owner continuously prioritizes effort of the team to work on topics for the next security belt. Of cause Product Owners shall only prioritize small chunks of work within the product backlog to be able to react to changed requirements. Security belt activities make good peaces to be put into the product backlog, because they are of reasonable size and have a defined output.

## Risk

- The team "has no time" to improve its software security.
- The team's initially good intention turns into frustration.
- Product Owner has no transparency of the investment and benefit of security belts.
- The team is not improving its software security.
