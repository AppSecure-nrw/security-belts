# Creation of Evil User Stories

Evil user stories are created that complement user stories from a security perspective.

Use a template like for normal user stores: As a *role*, I can *capability*, so that *receive benefit*.

## Risk

- User stories focus on functionality, hence security as a non functional requirement is neglected.
- Relevant security considerations are not performed.
- Security flaws are discovered late in the development and deployment process, which results in security risk and rework.

## Assessment

- Show *n* user stories and their evil user story counterparts.
