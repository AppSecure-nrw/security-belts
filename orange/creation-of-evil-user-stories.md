# Creation of Evil User Stories

## Activities

- Create evil user stories to complement user stories from a security perspective.
- Use a template like for normal user stores:
```
As a <role>, I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>.
```
- Create an *evil* user story by describing an attack scenario on an application. Keep in mind to cover abuse as well as misuse.

## Benefits

- The team also deals with security requirements.
- Relevant security considerations are performed.
- Security flaws can be discovered or prevented early.

## Assessment

- Show *n* user stories and their evil user story counterparts.
- Show how the team considers the evil user stories during design and implementation.
