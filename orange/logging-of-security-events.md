# Logging of Security Events

Security relevant events are logged. The following events tend to be security relevant:
- successful/failed login/logout
- creation, change, deletion of users
- errors during input validation and output creation
- exceptions and errors with security in their name
- :unicorn:

## Risk

- Security incident analysis takes significantly more time without propper security events, such that an attack can not be stoped before the attacker reaches his goal.

## Assessment

- Show which events are logged.
- Show a test for one event logging.
