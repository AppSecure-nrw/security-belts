# Shared Security Services

Do not reinvent the wheel. Prefer shared security services and components over implementing security controls yourself. Challenge that these services perform well and secure and make deficiencies transparent.

## Benefits

- Widely used software is less risky to use as problems are more likely to be discovered.
- You do not mess up subtile details of security controls that lead to vulnerabilities if not done right.

## Assessment

- Show the shared security services in your architecture.
- What do you use for:
  - Crypto
  - Parser (like file upload validation)
  - Unparser (like HTML generation)
  - Authentication, authorization
  - Session management
