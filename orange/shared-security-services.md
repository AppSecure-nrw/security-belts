# Shared Security Services

## Activities

- Do not reinvent the wheel.
- Prefer shared security services and components over implementing security controls yourself.
- Challenge that these services perform well and secure.
- Furthermore, make deficiencies transparent.

## Benefits

- Widely used software is less risky to use as problems are more likely to be discovered.
- Even minor mistakes in your own security controls could lead to serious security issues. By using shared services, you prevent this risk.

## Assessment

- Show the shared security services in your architecture.
- What do you use for:
  - Crypto
  - Parser (like file upload validation)
  - Unparser (like HTML generation)
  - Authentication, authorization
  - Session management
