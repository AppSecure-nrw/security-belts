# Test of Client Side Components With Known Vulnerabilities

## Activities

- Perform tests for known vulnerabilities in all third party client side software components (e.g., libs and frameworks) used by your software.
- If possible, use tools to automate this task as much as possible.

## Benefits

- Known vulnerabilities in used components are found and can be fixed.
- The developed software is not vulnerable to well established attacks.

## Assessment

- Show the tests and usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
