# Test of Client Side Components With Known Vulnerabilities

Perform tests for known vulnerabilities in all third party client side software components (libs, ...) used by your software.

## Benefits 

- testing components cancels out the risk of exploitation through attacks from automated tools using known vulnerabilities.

## Assessment

- Show the usage of the tool.
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
