# Team has a Security Champion

## Activities

- Find and train a [Security Champion](https://github.com/AppSecure-nrw/security-belts/wiki/Security-Champion) from within the team.

*Note*: The Security Champion should be a volunteer interested in software security. Just forcing someone to take the role is worse than having no Security Champion.

## Benefits

- The Security Champion brings security knowledge to the team so that the team can make informed security decisions and take responsibility for security.
- Central security experts can focus on other tasks.

## Assessment

- Show that the Security Champion has completed a security training.
- Show the improvements and activities made by the Security Champion, e.g., training the team and executing belt activities.
