# Team has a Security Champion

Security Champions bring security knowledge to teams so that they can take responsibility for security.

## Risk

- No one feels directly responsible for security.
- Central security experts do not have enough time to support each team.

## Assessment

- Has the Security Champion already completed the security training?
- Show *n* security improvement stories solved by several team members.
