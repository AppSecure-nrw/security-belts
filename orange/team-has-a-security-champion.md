# Team has a Security Champion

Find and train a [Security Champion](https://github.com/AppSecure-nrw/security-belts#security-champion) from within the team.

*Note*: The Security Champion should be a volunteer interested in software security. Just forcing someone to take the role is worse than having none.

## Benefits

- The Security Champion brings security knowledge to the team so that the team can take responsibility for security.
- Central security experts can focus on other tasks.

## Assessment

- Show that the Security Champion has already completed a security training.
- Show the time invested by the Security Champion.
