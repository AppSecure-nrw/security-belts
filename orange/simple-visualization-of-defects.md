# Simple Visualization of Defects

Vulnerabilities are visible to all team members responsible for the affected component.

## Risk

- The security level of a component is not visible. Therefore, the team sees no need in fixing vulnerabilities.

## Assessment

- Show the security defect collection.
- Show that every team member and the product owner has access.
