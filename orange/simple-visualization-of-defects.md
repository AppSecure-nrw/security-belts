# Simple Visualization of Defects

## Activities

- Collect defects (e.g., vulnerabilities, bugs) of software components the team is responsible.
- Make these defects visible to all team members.
- The collection should be up to date and easy to understand for every team member.

*Note*: Providing access to all team members is much more important than collecting all defects in one place.

## Benefits

- The quality of all software components is visible.
- The team is able to prioritize defects.

## Assessment

- Show all your defects.
- Show that every team member has access.
