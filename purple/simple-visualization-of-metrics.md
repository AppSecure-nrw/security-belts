# Simple Visualization of Metrics

## Activities

- Make the metrics of [Creation of Application Metrics](../purple/creation-of-application-metrics.md) visible to all team members
  - e.g.: create a dashboard with an overview of the most important metrics.
- The visualization should be up to date and easy to understand for every team member.


## Benefits

- The large amount of information is easier for humans to understand.
- You have a good feeling.
- Easier to identify boundaries in which the application performs under normal conditions.
  - This also supports implementing the activity [Targeted Alerting on Metric Violations](../purple/targeted-alerting-on-metric-violations.md).

## Assessment
