# Targeted Alerting on Metric Violations

## Activities

- Define thresholds for your security related metrics (e.g., failed logins).
- Define target groups who need to act on specific metric violations.
- Send out notifications, in case a threshold is exceeded.
- Continuously challenge and improve your metrics and thresholds.

## Benefits

- Attacks on your application, as well as unexpected or abnormal behavior, can be recognized in a timely manner.
- People are not spammed with notifications that they eventually start to ignore.
- Only the right persons that need to act on the notification are informed.

## Assessment

- Present your thresholds.
- Present your target groups.
- Show some of your latest notifications and how you handled it.

## Examples

Some good examples for security related metrics are:
- Number of failed login in a given time
- Number of requests against an API endpoint in a given time
- Average duration and outliers of processing time on API requests
- Average duration and outliers of processing time on database queries
