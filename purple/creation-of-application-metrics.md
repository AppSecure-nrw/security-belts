# Creation of Application Metrics

## Activities

- Gather key metrics on your application (e.g., failed logins) to identify security related events (e.g., brute force attacks).

## Benefits

- Attacks on your application can be recognized (e.g., based on anomalies).
- Metrics provide good feedback on usage of features.
- Know the value of features within your application.

## Assessment

- Present your metrics:
  - Show which security related metrics you have.
  - Show current metric data of your application.
