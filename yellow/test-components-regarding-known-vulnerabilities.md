# Test Components Regarding Known Vulnerabilities

## Activities

- Perform tests for known vulnerabilities in all software components used by your software (e.g., libraries, but not containers (see related belt activity)).

## Benefits

-  Known vulnerabilities in used components are found and can be fixed.
-  The developed software is not vulnerable to well established attacks.

## Assessment

- Show the tests and usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
