# Security Code Review

Perform code reviews of security-related software and infrastructure with the Security Champion Guild. The following areas of code tend to have a high-risk of containing security vulnerabilities:
  - Crypto implementations / usage
  - Parser, unparser
  - System configuration
  - Authentication, authorization
  - Session management
  - Request throttling
  - :unicorn: (self-developed code, only used in that one software)

## Benefits

- New vulnerabilities may be found before reaching production.
- Old vulnerabilities are found and fixed.

## Assessment

- Present the performed reviews (including participants, findings, consequences) and assess whether it is reasonable.
