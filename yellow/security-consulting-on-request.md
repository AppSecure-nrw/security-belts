# Security Consulting on Request

Actively consult security experts if your own knowledge is insufficient to solve security problems.

## Risk

- If a security expert is not involved in a security issue, it can lead to decisions that compromise software security.

## Assessment

- Show cases where you were able to solve security issues without help.
- Show cases where you could only solve security issues with help.
- Show cases in which you have treated false positives.
