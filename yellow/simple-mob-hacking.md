# Simple Mob Hacking

## Activities

- Participate with your whole team in a simple mob hacking session organized by the Security Champion Guild.
- In the session the guild presents a vulnerable application and together you look at possible exploits.
- Just like in mob programming there is one driver and several navigators.

Guidelines for your simple mob hacking session:
- All exploits happen via the user interface.
- No need for security/hacking tools.
- No need for deep technical or security knowledge.
- Use an insecure training app, e.g., [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/) or [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
- Encourage active participation, e.g., use small groups.
- Allow enough time for everyone to run at least one exploit.

## Benefits

- The team gets an idea of how exploits can look like and how easy applications can be attacked.
- The team understands functional correct working software can be highly insecure and easy to exploit.

## Assessment

- Report on the most surprising experiences from a session.
- Report on your lessons learned.
