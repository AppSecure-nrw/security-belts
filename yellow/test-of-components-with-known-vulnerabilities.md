# Test of components with known vulnerabilities

Tests for known vulnerabilities in all software components, like libraries and container images, used by your software are performed.

## Risk

-  Known vulnerabilities in used components can be exploited by automated tools without special knowledge about the specific software.
-  Known vulnerabilities are more likely to being exploited.

## Assessment

- Show the usage of the tool.
- Show the handling of the output.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
