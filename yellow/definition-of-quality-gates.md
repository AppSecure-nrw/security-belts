# Definition of Quality Gates

Define quality gates adhering to your companies policy. Make sure that all requirements are fulfilled. Also define quality gates for found vulnerabilities and provide feedback about vulnerabilities and time of exposure.

Be aware, by introducing this activity you might have a backlog with many findings from the past.
Provide transparency about this backlog and continuously fix the reported issues. Start with the most critical ones.
Make sure to adhere to the policy from now on and do not introduce new findings to your backlog.


## Benefits

- Helps to find vulnerabilities earlier. As such, it helps to mitigate the risk of exploitation. This is important, as the risk of exploitation continuously increases over time for a given vulnerability.
- Vulnerabilities are fixed in time.

## Assessment

- Show the definition of the gates.
- Show the usage of the gates.
- Show the treatment of rejected cases.
- Show your current exposure.
- Show how you handle false positives.
