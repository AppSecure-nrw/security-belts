# False Positive Treatment

In order to not overlook real vulnerabilities, false positives are suppressed so they will not show up on the next tests again.

For suppressions:
- Document a reasonable justification
- Practice review or pairing

## Risk

- As false positive occure during each test, all vulnerabilities might be ignored.

## Assessment

- Show your false positive list.
- Show reasonable justification for some false positives.
