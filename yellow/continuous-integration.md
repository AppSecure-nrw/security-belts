# Continuous Integration

Continuous automated building and testing of the software.

## Risk

- Quality not visible to everyone
- There is no single ground of truth
- Nondeterministic and nonreproducible builds
- Local development environment influences test output & artifact
- "it runs on my machine"

## Assessment

- Show your build pipeline and an exemplary job.
- Show that every team member has access.
- Show that failed jobs are fixed.
