# Continuous Integration

## Activities

- Use continuous automated building and testing of the software.

## Benefits

- There is a single instance deciding whether the code meets its quality (single ground of truth).
- Deterministic and reproducible builds

## Assessment

- Show your build pipeline and an exemplary job (build + test).
- Show that every team member has access.
- Show that failed jobs are fixed.
