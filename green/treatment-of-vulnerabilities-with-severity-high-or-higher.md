# Treatment of Vulnerabilities With Severity High or Higher

## Activities

- Focus on fixing the most relevant vulnerabilities without being overwhelmed of the potentially great number of low-impact findings.

## Benefits

- Prioritized treatment of most severe vulnerabilities.
- The software is free of high-impact vulnerabilities, which decreases the chance of successful denial of service attacks and loss or manipulation of confidential data.

## Assessment

- Show the fix for the latest *n* high severity findings.
- Show how you challenged the efficiency of the implemented fix.
