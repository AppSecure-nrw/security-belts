# Integration of vulnerability issues into the development process

Treat all your identified vulnerabilities the same way as your other user stories. Therefore, add them to the same board, preferably using an automated process.

## Benefits

- Creates visibility of the current state of issues and their treatment to the whole team.
- Enables priorization of security-relevant issues for the product owner.

## Assessment

- Verify that issues exist for all relevant vulnerabilities.
- Verify that vulnerabilities from all sources are included.
