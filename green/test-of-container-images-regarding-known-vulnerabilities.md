# Test of Container Images Regarding Known Vulnerabilities

Perform tests for known vulnerabilities in all container images used by your software. Use tools to automate your tests.

Note, that this can result in many found vulnerabilities. Check, whether they are fixed with the next build of the container image. See related Belt Activity: Container Update Enforcement.

## Benefits

-  Known vulnerabilities in used containers are found and can be fixed.
-  The developed software is not vulnerable to well established attacks.

## Assessment

- Show the tests and usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
