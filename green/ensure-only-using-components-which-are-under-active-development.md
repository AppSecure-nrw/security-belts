# Ensure Only Using Components Which Are Under Active Development

## Activities

- Ensure that you only use software components (e.g., libraries, applications) which are under active development.
- This also includes migrating software **before** it reaches end of life / support.

## Benefits

- All software components are up-to-date and receive security patches for discovered vulnerabilities.
- Newer technologies help to minimize your attack surface (e.g., use latest TLS version)
- Simplifies effective implementation of other belt activities.

## Assessment

- Show the established process or tooling that allows to regularly check the lifecycle of all used software components.
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
