Ensure that you only use software components (e.g., libraries, applications) which are under active development. This also includes migrating software **before** it reaches end of life / support.

## Benefits

- Newer technologies help to minimize your attack surface (e.g., use latest TLS version)
- Simplifies effective implementation of other belt activities.

## Assessment

- Show the established process or tooling that allows to regularly check the lifecycle of all used software components.
