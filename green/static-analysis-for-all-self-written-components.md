# Static analysis for all self-written components

Use static code analysis tools to find security vulnerabilities in all self-written components.

## Benefits

- Prevention of common vulnerabilities within your code during development.
- Static code analysis provides early feedback, such that developers can learn how to improve their code quality and avoid vulnerabilities in the future.

## Assessment

- Show the tests and usage of the tool(s).
- Show the handling of the results.
- Show the latest *n* findings.
- Show your false positive list.
