# Treatment of vulnerabilities with high criticality

Focus on fixing the most relevant vulnerabilities without being overwhelmed of the potentially great number of low-impact findings.

## Benefits

- Prioritized treatment of most severe vulnerabilities.
- The software is free of high-impact vulnerabilities, which decreases the chance of denial of service attacks and lost or manipulation of confidential data.

## Assessment

- Show the fix for the latest *n* high criticality findings.
- Show how you challenged the efficiency of the implemented fix.
